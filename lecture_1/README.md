# Lecture 1 - PDF reading, conversion, transcription, and arrangement via Expertise, Creativity, Pattern recognition, and Design. The four attributes of a programmer. 

### In this video we actively learn and apply our newly acquired knowledge to read a pdf, convert it to a usable string, transcribe it into organized lists, and arrange them in a csv file using the Pandas Software Library. We dwell on the philosophical and technical procedures that this takes. Rather than following a memorized set of steps, we approach the problem and utilize creativity, expertise, pattern recognition, and design to solve it. This intrinsically reveals four behaviors that the art of programming produce.
